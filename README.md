# The Ugly Neural Network (Duckling)
The idea of this repo is for my own selfish reason of: building a neural network from scratch. The main factor is that the code will be prioritised to be written in an understandable way, over efficiency. Basically apprecaite the core building blocks of a naural network, as there are already a lot of neural networks out there that are efficiently written (so this will not be one of them).
